. handle partly-filled buffer in fdgets
. set up write/read and then copy in main loop
. how to handle write_complete better?
. global connection_closed flag?
. split up in more files to make it easier to find something

Planned changes
. make it easier to find out which child does what (SIGINFO?)
. timeouts
. don't send data to 'Send' connections -- they quit in this case
. download speed indicator during download
. some commands to dccserver:
  . show open connections (to who, type, time, transferred data)
  . close specific connections
. add option to create per-remote download dirs
. regression tests
. make configure.ac/Makefile.am smarter -- not both programs need
  all replacement functions or -lpoll
. warn in autoconf if poll and sys/poll.h are not found, not in
  dccserver.c.
. stop particular child processes

Possible changes
. make get work
. make fserve work
. bind to specific IP only
. disallow particular clients
. readline
. include poll-emulation

dccsend:
. verify remote nickname
. handle timeouts

Might want to fix:
