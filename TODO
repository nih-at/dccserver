Planned changes
. don't send data to 'Send' connections -- they quit in this case
. add option to create per-remote download dirs
. regression tests
. make configure.ac/Makefile.am smarter -- not both programs need
  all replacement functions or -lpoll
. warn in autoconf if poll and sys/poll.h are not found, not in
  dccserver.c.
. split source up in more files to make it easier to find something

Possible changes
. make get work
. make fserve work
. bind to specific IP only
. disallow particular clients
. readline
. include poll-emulation
. remove stalled time from average speed calculation

dccsend:
. verify remote nickname
. handle timeouts

Might want to fix:

dccserver.c:635: warning: passing arg 3 of `accept' from incompatible pointer type
