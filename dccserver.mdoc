.It Fl p Ar port

After a client has connected, you can send commands to it manually.
This is useful for chats or fserves.
The syntax is
.Dq <nn>: <text>
where
.Dq <nn>
is the number of the child, and
.Dq <text>
the text you want to send.
For example:
.Dl 0: dir
Please note that the
.Dq \&:
and the space are necessary.
.Pp
Text coming from the remote clients will be shown prepended by their
nickname.

.Sh BUGS
Get and Fserve modes are not yet supported.
.Pp
There are no timeouts yet.

The program should probably be setuid to handle ports below 1024
better.
.Pp
It is not easy to see which child number corresponds to which remote
client (nickname).
