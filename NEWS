0.4:
	Add "close" command; close particular connections.

	Added proper timeout handling.

	Add "info" command; shows current transfer states for all
	connections. Sending dccserver a SIGINFO (or SIGUSR1 on
	systems without SIGINFO) signal works too.

	Added poll replacement function from Brian M Clapper
	for building on Darwin.

	Show time taken by transfers and transfer rate.

	dccserver can now listen on multiple ports; just specify
	-p multiple times.
	Requested by Maik Zumstrull <Maik.Zumstrull@gmx.de>.

0.3:
	Add dccsend program to send files to a remote dccserver.
	Requested by Antti Aaltonen <antzu@iki.fi>.

	Try to handle it more gracefully when two or more clients
	want to write to the same file. Idea from Rudolf Polzer.

	Add lots of fflushes, some from Rudolf Polzer.

	Strip paths from file name (some weird clients send them).
	Requested by Athan <code@miggy.org>.

	Remove superfluous seteuid call. Noted by Athan <code@miggy.org>

	Mention client ID/client name in most places. Based on patches
	from Rudolf Polzer <atfield@durchnull.de>.

	Add -e/-i options for easy embedding in irssi. Idea from
	from Rudolf Polzer <atfield@durchnull.de>.

	Add "quit" command to exit dccserver. Idea from Rudolf
	Polzer <atfield@durchnull.de>.

	Some minor improvements, see ChangeLog.

0.2:
	Allow receiving more bytes than filesize; show a warning.
	Could be useful when sender doesn't have the complete file when
	starting the dcc send, and in some other cases. Based on patches
	by Per von Zweigbergk <pvz@e.kth.se>.

	Install as setuid root; drop privileges as soon as possible,
	and chroot to current directory. Based on patches by
	Per von Zweigbergk <pvz@e.kth.se>.

	Debian package support, provided by Aubin Paul <debian@outlyer.org>.

0.1:
	First public release.
