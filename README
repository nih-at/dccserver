dccserver is a standalone program aiming to provide the functions
of mIRC's /dccserver command.

Currently, Chat and Send (including resume) modes are supported.
Fserve and Get mode are not yet supported.

All connections are accepted; some simple checks on allowed file
names are done.  For more details, please look in the man pages.

Also included is dccsend, a program to send files to remotely
running dccservers.

If you package this program, please reference either of
	ftp.nih.at /pub/nih/dccserver/
	http://www.nih.at/dccserver/
as the master distribution site.

Please send bug reports, comments, and praise to
