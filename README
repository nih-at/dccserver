dccserver aims to provide the functions of MIRC's /dccserver command.

Currently, Chat and Send (including resume) modes are supported.
Fserve and Get mode are not yet supported.

All connections are accepted; some simple checks on allowed file names
are done.

Usage:
dccserver [-n nickname] [-p port]

The nickname should argument should be set to the user name you use in
your IRC client.
The port argument defaults to 59, the MIRC default -- please note: To
bind to ports below 1024 you have to be root.

To manually send commands to the remote clients (for chats or
fserves), type:
	<nn>: <text>
where <nn> is the number of the child, and the space after the `:' is
important, e.g.,
	0: dir

Please send bug reports, comments, and praise to <tk@giga.or.at>.
